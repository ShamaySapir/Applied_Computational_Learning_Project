Applied_Computational_Learning_Project

To run the project:
  1. At the terminal run - pip install -r requirements.txt
  2. Run main.
     The main runs on each file the 3 algorithms. 
     - Supervised Model
     - Pseudo-Label Semi-Supervised Model
     - Improved Pseudo-Label Semi-Supervised Model
     
  This is an implementation of the semi-supervised aproach called pseudo-label using Keras. 
  This algorithm is based on article "Pseudo-Label : The Simple and Efficient Semi-Supervised Learning Method for Deep Neural Networks" by Dong-Hyun Lee (@donghyunlee).
